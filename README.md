# CodeReact
This is a project written in React to display domains and information about them.

First, install the dependencies.

npm install

To just build the project, run:

npm run build

To build and serve the project locally, run:

npm run start

Note:
The app component is the main component, the Selection component is the detailed view.
For the List view I have used React JSON-table module. The link for the module can be found here-https://github.com/arqex/react-json-table.git

In this project , we have also used Font-awesome and Bootstrap for styling.

The project is run locally on localhost:8080 which gives  list view as shown in the document.txt file:

On clicking any of the domain names the page is redirected to the detailed view(shown in document.txt).
